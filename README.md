**Conversational Agent Workflow for Software Development Process**

This project showcases a conversational agent workflow designed to streamline the software development process, incorporating the expertise of programmers, testers, debuggers, and executors. Built on the Langchain framework and integrated with OpenAI's GPT model, the system facilitates dynamic interactions between agents and users to efficiently address various aspects of software development.

**Key Features:**

1. **Role-based Agents:** The system features four distinct agents, each representing a key role in the software development lifecycle: Programmer, Tester, Debugger, and Executor. Each agent is equipped with specialized prompts and functionalities tailored to their respective responsibilities.

2. **Flexible Workflow Management:** Leveraging Langgraph's StateGraph, the workflow can be dynamically configured to adapt to different scenarios and project requirements. Conditional edges enable seamless transitions between agents based on the flow of the development process.

3. **Integration with GPT Model:** The system leverages OpenAI's GPT model to generate contextually relevant responses and suggestions, enhancing the quality of interactions and outcomes. Users can input questions, requirements, or code snippets, and the agents utilize GPT to provide relevant feedback and assistance.

**Workflow Configuration:**

- **Agent Definition:** The system defines four agent types, each encapsulating specific roles and responsibilities in the software development process. Agents are initialized with custom prompts and tools to guide their interactions with users.

- **Workflow Design:** Using a combination of agent nodes, conditional edges, and state management, the workflow orchestrates the sequence of interactions between agents and users. The entry point is set at the Programmer agent, and transitions occur based on user input and agent actions.

**Usage Scenarios:**

- **Programming Phase:** The Programmer agent assists users in developing Python code by guiding them through problem understanding, algorithm selection, pseudocode creation, and code generation.

- **Testing Phase:** The Tester agent supports users in creating basic and edge test cases to validate the functionality and robustness of the code. Users can input requirements and code snippets, and the agent generates relevant test cases accordingly.

- **Debugging Phase:** The Debugger agent analyzes provided code and error messages to identify and rectify errors. Users receive error-free code solutions tailored to the detected issues.

- **Execution Phase:** The Executor agent adds a testing layer to the code and validates its execution using provided input and expected output. Users can ensure code functionality and reliability before deployment.

**Integration and Deployment:**

- **Environment Setup:** Users can initialize the system by configuring environment variables, including the OpenAI API key and Langchain project settings.

- **Deployment Options:** The system can be deployed locally or on cloud platforms, offering scalability and accessibility to developers and teams involved in software development projects.
